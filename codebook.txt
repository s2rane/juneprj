subject_id: Represents the subject in the experiment
activity_id:Represent the activity id that is being measured in the experiment
activity_desc: Represents the description of the above id

The below measurements are the means of various measure that were collected and represented in the dataset tidy.txt

The postfix -X,-Y,-Z represent the measurement with respect to X,Y and Z axes.
